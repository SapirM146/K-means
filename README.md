# Parallel implementation of K-Means Algorithm

Final project - Course: Parallel and Distributed Computation 

In this project I used MPI, OpenMP and CUDA technologies to implement the algorithm.

The solution I chose allows the processes to work in parallel at most stages of the algorithm,
while using the graphic card to accelerate the processe.
